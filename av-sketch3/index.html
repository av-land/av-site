		<p>PLACEHOLDER. In a laboratory in Denver, on a decommissioned U.S. Army base, a baby sits in a high chair with two electrodes attached to his chest. To his left, on a small table, a muffin tin holds four numbered cups, each filled with a green substance. On the walls and the ceiling, four cameras and an omnidirectional microphone record the baby’s every burble and squawk, then transmit them to a secure server in an adjacent room. What looks like a window with blinds, across the room from the baby, is in fact a two-way mirror with a researcher behind it, scribbling notes. The baby’s mother takes a spoonful of the first sample and lifts it to the baby’s mouth, and the experiment begins.</p>

		<p>PLACEHOLDER Mars in Scorpio is the private detective of epic proportions. There is no way to derail this set up. Once it’s on the scent of what’s captivated its imagination, it is more than a dog with a bone, it is a master strategist. As it teams up with Mercury, which is about to station direct, we can all use this transit to get down to business and gather the evidence necessary to prove our case.</p>
